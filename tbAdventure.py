""" Version 1.1 - Structure
- Put everything into functions
- created a main function
- added comments to each function
- appended each functions input arguments with argument type
- added needed white space
- reduced line size

    Version 1.2 - Consolidation
- combine functions turning_right and turning_left
- instead of clearing screen in main funtion just
    before calling main_display, it is now cleared
    in main_display
- added upser input to the main_display function
- created a function to initialize the main arguments
- moved function comments from outside the function to within
- randomized the initial direction and room
- made forward a function to clean up main
